# auto_reply_agent
This project is a WhatsApp auto-reply agent that manages your status and automatically responds to calls and messages when you’re busy. You control your status (busy/free) using simple API commands, and the agent sends human-like replies to contacts when you’re unavailable. It’s designed for easy deployment, persistent operation, and customizable.
